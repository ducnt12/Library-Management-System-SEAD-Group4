# Library Management System

## TODO

1. Design:

	- [ ] micro-service architecture using REST API

	- [ ] must generate random data in order to get at least 1 million records for load testing.

	- [ ] incorporate cache technology, select among Memcache or Reddis or others.

	- [ ] message queue, select among JMS or Kafka.

	- [ ] must develop it on Docker

	- [ ] Single sign on with OAuth2

	- [ ] system should be deployed to AWS cloud system or any other platforms. 

2. Functionality:

- As the focus of this course is about architecture, functionality is minimally required. However, students need to demonstrate a small system that deliver at least 1 core set of useful functionality.

3. Testing:

- It is important that students load enough big data to prove that their architecture design is sound for scalability, i.e. thousands concurrent requests per second.
